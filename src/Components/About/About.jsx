                Hi, I’m <span className='text-3xl text-white'>Dhanam Patel</span> — aka <span className='text-3xl text-white'>Athanox</span> — a 20-year-old building LLM-powered AI systems focused on retrieval-augmented generation, scalable ML APIs, and real-world deployment. Most of my time goes into designing end-to-end pipelines — from messy data and embeddings to clean, production-ready backends.
                <br /><br />
                Currently exploring retrieval optimization, PyTorch-based model fine-tuning, LLM evaluation, and scalable AI deployment on GCP — turning experiments into real-world systems.
